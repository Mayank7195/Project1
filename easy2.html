    Tommy the turtle loved to explore. He’d crawl around his garden, under leaves, and over rocks. One day, he saw a bright, shiny object. It was a beautiful, golden leaf! Tommy was curious. He wanted to know where it came from.

So, he asked a wise old owl. The owl hooted and said, “That’s a special leaf, Tommy. It falls from the Golden Tree during the autumn. It’s said to bring good luck to whoever finds it.”

Tommy was excited. He decided to keep the leaf safe. He put it in a little box and kept it under his bed. Every night before bed, he’d look at the leaf and dream of good luck. And you know what? The next day, he found a delicious worm right outside his shell!
